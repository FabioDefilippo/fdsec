Some security tools!

## What is it?
These tools help You check for a malware infection through common behaviors!

## How to use theme?
1. Download and compile these codes (I don't take responsibility for loading the binaries yet, maybe later);
2. Run ollydbg.exe and then security-check.exe;

## And Then?
If a malware will kill ollydbg.exe or Windows Defender process, security-check.exe will shutdown the System to stop the infection!

## WARNING:
If You do not use Windows Defender, delete or comment msmpeng.exe block of code!
